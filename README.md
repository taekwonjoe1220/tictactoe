# Tic Tac Toe for The Odin Project

## Version 1.0
Working version of the Tic Tac Toe app is almost complete. Everything is working, but could use some minor updates / optimizations.

## ** List of updates to make as of 2/6 **

~~1. (NEED TO DO) Finish functionality of tie mechanic ** DONE **
2. (SHOULD DO) Add media queries and work on responsiveness for mobile
3. (SHOULD DO) Fix object nesting so that users don't have access to certain methods/variables - right now users can manually change the turn in the console
4. (WANT TO DO) Update logic to reduce the number of times it needs to check for a winner (for turncount >= 5 only)
5. (WANT TO DO) Possibly add some animations to show a line across the winning row/column/diagonal
6. (WANT TO DO) Add in an AI component - not a high priority, but would be awesome to complete
